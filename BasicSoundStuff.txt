Music Stuff basic write-up:

Every track of sound is actually a collection of clips of variable length, using the processing.sound library.
Each track will be its own object, with two arrays- one will contain the individual soundFiles,
and the other will hold the length in milliseconds of each clip.

There will be a playNextClip() method. It will take the track number of the current clip, 
and using a custom gaussian distribution dependent upon the clip that just ended, randomly determine
what the next clip will be. Different clips will have certain others weighted to play after them,
but any clip could follow up any other clip within the track.

When a track change is detected, the current one will begin to decrease in volume as the other 'enters,'
starting quiet and getting louder- most likely inversely proportional to each other.
Effects might be applied to either track as this transition occurs. I might or might not 
make special clips for each track that plays when it enters or when it exits.

Depending upon the number of clips in a track, the standard deviation may need to be changed.

When a new clip is played, a variable will record the milliseconds since the start of the program
at that moment, and then the program will read the duration in milliseconds of the clip being played.

Once that duration has passed, a new clip will play and the tracking milliseconds variable will be updated.
