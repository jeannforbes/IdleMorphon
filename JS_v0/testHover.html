<!--
create an upper div that is empty but checks to see if your mouse is hovering
over it, and if your mouse is, toggle the visibility

so I want
position: fixed;
top:50px;
right: 0;
height: 100%;
width: 150px;

line 379: change to a three-index array, cycle between the three.

create new kind of element, detBox that detects the position,
and then another one called invisBox that takes the list of things and 
shows one to select

have images for each node type
and reference the current variable storing the index by setting it to the 
appropriate number for each node type. spacebar switches between the sizes by 
adding anything from 0-2 to the stored index, which would become the color.
